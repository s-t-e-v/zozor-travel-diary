- I start by structuring the HTML file with semantic markup

> 15:15
- I sketched on piece of paper the box structuring the webpage
  with semantic markup associated.
- I analyzed the layout and the design files and came to 
  conclusion that the width of the page is the same of the
  sanfranscisco.jpg slaph picture.

> 15:17
- width of the webpage: 950px

> 16:22
I finish doing the HTML with semantic markup. Now it's to do the CSS part.
First, I'm going to retrieve the color via GIMP.
Then, I'm going to try to determine font-size with GIMP
Afterthat, I'm going to follow the advice of Frontend Mentor: starting by 
formatting the fonts. Let's do it incha'Allah.

> 17:25
I got the color, however not the font size.
Now let's start with font formatting.

> 18:30
I finished with formatting fonts. Now, I'm going to tackle
the header. Incha'Allah.

> 18:40
Done for the header. Now we are going for the horizontal bar on the top.
Incha'Allah.

> 18:49
I'm done with the top horizontal rule. Let's do the splash image after commiting.

> 19:33
Finally done with the splash image. Let's do the main page
general layout incha'Allah

> 20:01
I finished to give size to main, and also to aside.
Now, I'm going to shape aside and what's inside.
Incha'Allah

> 20:50:
We finished the aside layout. Now we are going to atack the
footer.
We are going to first do the general layout. Then we will do
sequentially all the sub content. Incha'Allah.

> 20:57:
/!\ I should create a new branch for putting 'Zozor' and 'Carnets de voyage'
close to each other, without space. And also for 
increasing the size of navigation items.

> 20:58:
Before doing the footer, I have to do the bottom top_hrule

> 21:00:
/!\ I have to add to the aside sub_container the triange.
/ok\ Don't forget to set the background color for header, main and footer.
main is a darker wheat color.
