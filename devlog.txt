- I start by structuring the HTML file with semantic markup

> 15:15
- I sketched on piece of paper the box structuring the webpage
  with semantic markup associated.
- I analyzed the layout and the design files and came to 
  conclusion that the width of the page is the same of the
  sanfranscisco.jpg slaph picture.

> 15:17
- width of the webpage: 950px

> 16:22
I finish doing the HTML with semantic markup. Now it's to do the CSS part.
First, I'm going to retrieve the color via GIMP.
Then, I'm going to try to determine font-size with GIMP
Afterthat, I'm going to follow the advice of Frontend Mentor: starting by 
formatting the fonts. Let's do it incha'Allah.

> 17:25
I got the color, however not the font size.
Now let's start with font formatting.

> 18:30
I finished with formatting fonts. Now, I'm going to tackle
the header. Incha'Allah.

> 18:40
Done for the header. Now we are going for the horizontal bar on the top.
Incha'Allah.

> 18:49
I'm done with the top horizontal rule. Let's do the splash image after commiting.

> 19:33
Finally done with the splash image. Let's do the main page
general layout incha'Allah

> 20:01
I finished to give size to main, and also to aside.
Now, I'm going to shape aside and what's inside.
Incha'Allah

> 20:50:
We finished the aside layout. Now we are going to atack the
footer.
We are going to first do the general layout. Then we will do
sequentially all the sub content. Incha'Allah.

> 20:57:
/!\ I should create a new branch for putting 'Zozor' and 'Carnets de voyage'
close to each other, without space. And also for 
increasing the size of navigation items.

> 20:58:
Before doing the footer, I have to do the bottom top_hrule

> 21:00:
/ok\ I have to add to the aside sub_container the triange.
/ok\ Don't forget to set the background color for header, main and footer.
main is a darker wheat color.

> 23:15:
I did the bottom_hrule, the footer. I also add the triangle.
Appart from the layout for the title in the header and the nav part, project done!

I'm going back to the code in order to have eyebird view of what I did, and better
compare to the Openclassroom solution.

I'm currently googling "how to review code" and "comment best pratices html code".

> 15:59:

HTML:
I began with the head part.
- In the head tag:
  - I set encoding to UTF-8
  - I put a line I don't fully understand that is supposed to display site properly
  based on user's device
  - I set the tab icon
  - I linked the file to stylessheet file "styles.css"
  - I set the title of the web page
Then, I

I am adding some comment.

HTML:
- I structured the body like so:
  1. header
  2. top horizontal line
  3. div which contain the main content and the "splash" image
  4. bottom horizontal line
  5. Foooter

I was thinking about the best way to do this code review.

In the meantime, I discovered a great web page on best pratices in html. Here the
link: 

  HTML Style Guide
  https://gist.github.com/ryansechrest/8693303

I'm thinking about turning this develog into a .md file. It may be nicer to read.

So I though about a strategy to the review there is what I came up for:

1. Set clearly the goal. The goal here is:
  - to bring to light the logic behind the code, how it is structured
  and how one choose to solve the different issues.
  - help you write better code for the personnal website
2. I have to do the process for my code and the Openclassroom code.
3. Then I compare the way of both codes, keep what is good in my code, point what 
is not good and what should I do instead.
4. Make a sumary of what you learn from the process in both codes. Highligh good
pratices, best way to solve problem to help the future you.

Looking on google for "how to learn from code".

This helped me for the code review strategy:

  Best Practices for Code Review
  https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/9-best-practices-for-code-review

> 17:16:

I read quickly these web pages. I save it here because it may be very interesting
to apply the advice in here.

Before posting the links bellow, I learn from those posts that it was important to
read codes to better write codes, as for writting. You become a better writter
with more vocabulary, etc. by reading other writtings. So, I think I should also
read more, to become better I expressing myself in French and in English. However,
I have to do it the Halal way. How? I don't know.

I really don't want to do it, but I'm doing it anyway. I will never achieve anything if I keep
procradtinating. Let's do it

10:54:

I'm starting by retrieving review writting on this file and put in a dedicated markdown file.

11:06:

The HTML is reviewed. Now we are reviewing the CSS part

11:14:

I am also adding some comments in the CSS file.

11:22:

Doing the code review pushes me to commenting HTML and CSS code, so the structure
of the file appear more obviously.

13:35:

I finish to review my code. Now, I'm going to use the web checker to correct my html file.
Afterwards, I will review the code of Mathieu, maybe in my head, or by writting it.
In the process, I will raise the difference but my code and his code.

15:28:

I correct the html file. No errors or warnings now according to https://validator.w3.org/
