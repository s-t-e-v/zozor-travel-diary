## My process

### Built with

- [Design files direct download link](https://course.oc-static.com/ftp-tutos/cours/html-css/p3/ch4/tp_images_polices.zip) - For styles

### What I learned

Below are the major things I learned throughout this project.

#### First thing

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to focus one at least one of these areas:

- Drafting README file while doing the project. Saving useful links during the coding process. So I don't have to struggle recalling the hows and whys.
- Commenting my CSS code, so I can understand my code when I return to it several days later.
- Using flexbox with more elegance
- Using Git/Github in a more efficient. Especially by using branches.
- Custom fonts integration: I feel like I am not in full control of font-weight, font-size, and also of how it is displayed in different browsers.
- Mastering other layout method (`position: absolute`, `relative`; inline-block, etc.). Because sometimes I feel flexbox doesn't give all the flexibility I want during my design process.
- Understanding more about how text, block, etc. are structured and designed. So I can better arrange elements.
- Structuring HTML file more efficiently: no useless "id", "class", "div". Also better choice in tags. I feel the structure of my HTML isn't optimal.
- Writing lesser amount of CSS code
- Using media queries to be comfortable with.

### Useful resources

The resources bellow gave me the necessary knowledge to complete this project:
